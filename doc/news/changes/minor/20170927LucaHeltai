Fixed: One of the functions GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point() 
supports an additional `mapping` argument. This mapping was used
to actually transform points from the real to the reference space, 
but somewhere in the algorithm we look for the `closest_vertex` to 
the target point. Such search was done ignoring if the `mapping` 
actually changes the location of the vertices. This is now fixed,
and the internal function that looks for the closest vertex now
takes into account the `mapping` transformation.
