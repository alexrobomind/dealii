Fixed: Copying a Trilinos::MPI::Vector to a local deal.II Vector using 
operator=() resulted in only a partial copy of data to the local vector. In 
addition, the copied  elements  were offset incorrectly on each process. 
Similar held for copying a  Trilinos::MPI::BlockVector to a local deal.II 
BlockVector. This has been fixed and now works as expected.
