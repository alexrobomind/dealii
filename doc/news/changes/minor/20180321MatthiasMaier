New: Added a third test variant to the testsuite driver: For a test
consisting of a test.prm.in (and a test.output) file the test.prm.in file
will be configured/preprocessed to a test.prm file. This is done with the
CMake macro CONFIGURE_FILE that replaces all strings @VARIABLE@ with the
contents of the corresponding CMake variable. This is useful in particular
to conveniently substitute @SOURCE_DIR@ with the full source directory path
of the test.
